## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

![MPG linear regression](Resources/Linear_Regression.png)

 - Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset? vehicle weight, spoiler_angle, AWD
 - Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not? No, it is not (p-value: 5.35e-11)
 - Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not? Because R-squared = 0.7149, roughtly 71.49% of future data can be correctly predicted.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

 - The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not? While variances and standard deviations of lot 1 and lot 2 are in an acceptable range, lot 3 has variance of 170 and standard deviation of 13. This is not usual and should be assessed in depth.
