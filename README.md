## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

![MPG linear regression](Resources/Linear_Regression.png)

 - Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset? vehicle weight, spoiler_angle, AWD
 - Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not? No, it is not (p-value: 5.35e-11)
 - Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not? Because R-squared = 0.7149, roughtly 71.49% of future data can be correctly predicted.
